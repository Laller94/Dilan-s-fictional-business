# Dilan's fictional business
Dilan is a world traveler and a solo entrepreneur. He writes a travel blog where he sells info products: a $8 e-book (World Travelers' Best Practices) and a $80 video course (How To Travel the World).
On his blog he has thousands of readers every day, coming from three sources: Reddit, SEO and AdWords.
Dilan writes about his travel experiences covering the 6 main continents of the planet - these are the main categories on the blog.

My aim was to uncover actionable insights that would propel Dilan's business growth and inform strategic decision-making through data.  For this purpose I analyzed the following metrics:

Revenue Analysis

Funnel Analysis

Cohort Analysis

Conversion Rate 

Monthly and Daily User Trends

Key insights from the the analysis:

Revenue Analysis: From the data, it can be observed that"country_5" has generated the highest revenue, followed by "country_2" and "country_7". On the other hand "country_1" has generated the lowest revenue.
Based on only the revenue, Dilan should focus on "country_5" because that is where most of his income flows in.

Funnel Analysis: "country_1" and "country_8" has better retention rate, although there are less customers in these countries.

Cohort Analysis: There is a high churn rate, most customers keep dropping out in a week or so.

Conversion rate: The conversion rate is low to medium, but those customers who subscribe to Dilans' newsletter are more likely to buy his products.

Monthly and Daily User Trends: From the three months data, the visitors of Dilans' blog is in an increasing tendeny.
